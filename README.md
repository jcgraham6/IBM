# IBM
Repository to match the IBM Data Science course

# Purpose
This repository is intended to track all projects that are part of the IBM Data Science course from Coursera. 
I will upload all relevant datasets and code here

Link to the class is [here](https://www.ibm.com/data-science?utm_content=SRCWW&p1=Search&p4=43700050329215933&p5=e&gclid=CjwKCAiAs8acBhA1EiwAgRFdw9DkcTlo9QeExCxIqIglt_v9sdMRc8KsRcYvD53o4kDTDwwJhJh0ixoC7A4QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) 

Following completion of the course, I will come back to write a review. Please feel free to add your own feedback on the course or projects!
